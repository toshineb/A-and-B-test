# A/B Testing for Data-Driven Decision Making

## Project Overview

This project presents a robust **A/B testing analysis** using Python to determine the impact of changes in a product, marketing, or user interface. It simulates a controlled experiment where users are split into two groups **Group A (Control)** and **Group B (Variant)** to test whether a new design, feature, or strategy improves key performance metrics such as **conversion rate, click-through rate (CTR), or revenue per user**.

> Designed for data-backed decisions, this notebook follows the best practices in experimental design, hypothesis testing, and effect size interpretation.

## Problem Statement

> "Does the new version of a product or webpage outperform the original in terms of user engagement and conversion?"

By using A/B testing principles, this project answers critical business questions with statistical confidence, eliminating guesswork from product decisions.

## What This Project Covers

- Hypothesis Formulation (Null vs Alternative)
- Exploratory Data Analysis of both groups
- Normality Testing (Shapiro-Wilk, Histograms)
- Statistical Tests (t-test, Welch’s t-test)
- p-value interpretation and significance thresholding
- Actionable Recommendation based on effect size

---

## Key Insights

- The average conversion rate for **Group B** exceeded that of **Group A** by a statistically significant margin (p < 0.05).
- Distributions were assessed for normality; appropriate test (e.g., Welch’s t-test) was selected based on variance assumptions.
- The confidence interval shows practical significance, suggesting the treatment is **not only statistically significant but also impactful.**

> This kind of analysis is crucial for **growth teams, marketers, and product managers** aiming to drive real change through experimentation.
